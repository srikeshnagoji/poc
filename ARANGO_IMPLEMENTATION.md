# ArangoDB Nested Search Performance Testing Implementation Guide

## Project Overview
This implementation demonstrates ArangoDB's performance characteristics when dealing with deeply nested search queries across multiple collections in a hierarchical data model. We'll compare this with the MongoDB implementation, focusing on graph capabilities and query performance.

## Technical Stack
- **Backend Framework**: Express.js
- **Database**: ArangoDB
- **Driver**: ArangoJS (Official Node.js Driver)

## Data Model Design

### Collections
1. **Companies**
   - Document collection
   - Properties: name, industry, foundedYear, revenue

2. **Branches**
   - Document collection
   - Properties: name, location, established

3. **Departments**
   - Document collection
   - Properties: name, budget, headCount

4. **Employees**
   - Document collection
   - Properties: firstName, lastName, email, salary, joinDate, position

### Edge Collections
1. **company_branches**
   - Connects Company → Branch

2. **branch_departments**
   - Connects Branch → Department

3. **department_employees**
   - Connects Department → Employee

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Database Setup
- Create document collections
- Create edge collections
- Set up indexes for frequently queried fields

### 2. Data Generation
- Implement similar data generation patterns as MongoDB
- Use batch operations for efficient data insertion
- Maintain relationships using edge collections

### 3. Query Patterns
Implement the same three query patterns using AQL:

1. **Find employees by company industry**
   - Traverse from Company → Employee
   - Use graph traversal for efficient nested searches

2. **Find high-salary employees by location**
   - Start from Branch collection
   - Traverse to Employee through Department
   - Filter by location and salary

3. **Find large departments by industry**
   - Traverse from Company → Department
   - Filter by industry and headCount

### 4. Performance Comparison Points
- Query execution time
- Memory usage
- Scalability with data volume
- Index utilization
- Graph traversal vs nested aggregation

## API Endpoints

### Data Generation
```
POST /api/arango/generate-data
Body: {
  "companyCount": 100,
  "branchesPerCompany": 5,
  "deptsPerBranch": 8,
  "employeesPerDept": 100
}
```

### Search Operations
1. **Industry-based Employee Search**
```
GET /api/arango/search/employees-by-company-industry/:industry
```

2. **Location-based High-Salary Employee Search**
```
GET /api/arango/search/high-salary-by-location/:location
```

3. **Industry-based Large Department Search**
```
GET /api/arango/search/large-departments-by-industry/:industry
```

## Performance Testing Approach

1. **Data Generation Testing**
   - Verify document creation
   - Validate edge connections
   - Test batch operations

2. **Query Performance Testing**
   - Measure AQL query execution times
   - Compare with MongoDB aggregation pipeline times
   - Test with various data volumes

3. **Edge Cases**
   - Handle missing connections
   - Test with invalid traversal paths
   - Verify error handling

## Expected Advantages of ArangoDB
1. Native graph capabilities for relationship traversal
2. Flexible AQL for complex queries
3. Efficient edge collection management
4. Built-in graph visualization tools
5. Potential performance benefits for deeply nested queries

## Implementation Steps
1. Set up ArangoDB environment
2. Create collections and indexes
3. Implement data generation logic
4. Create graph queries
5. Build API endpoints
6. Implement performance monitoring
7. Compare with MongoDB results
